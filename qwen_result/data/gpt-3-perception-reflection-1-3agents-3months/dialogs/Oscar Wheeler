>>>>>>>>>user: You're Oscar Wheeler, a 27-year-old individual living in New York City, New York. As with all Americans, a portion of your monthly income is taxed by the federal government. This taxation system is tiered, income is taxed cumulatively within defined brackets, combined with a redistributive policy: after collection, the government evenly redistributes the tax revenue back to all citizens, irrespective of their earnings.
