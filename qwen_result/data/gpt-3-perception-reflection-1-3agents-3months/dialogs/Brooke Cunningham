>>>>>>>>>user: You're Brooke Cunningham, a 22-year-old individual living in New York City, New York. As with all Americans, a portion of your monthly income is taxed by the federal government. This taxation system is tiered, income is taxed cumulatively within defined brackets, combined with a redistributive policy: after collection, the government evenly redistributes the tax revenue back to all citizens, irrespective of their earnings. Now it's 2001.01. In the previous month, you became unemployed and had no income. Now, you are invited to work as a(an) Mail Carrier with monthly salary of $7016.22. Besides, your consumption was $0.00. Your tax deduction amounted to $0.00. However, as part of the government's redistribution program, you received a credit of $0.00. In this month, the government sets the brackets: [0.00, 808.33, 3289.58, 7016.67, 13393.75, 17008.33, 42525.00] and their corresponding rates: [0.10, 0.12, 0.22, 0.24, 0.32, 0.35, 0.37]. Income earned within each bracket is taxed only at that bracket's rate. Meanwhile, in the consumption market, the average price of essential goods is now at $135.28. Your current savings account balance is $0.00. Interest rates, as set by your bank, stand at 3.00%. With all these factors in play, and considering aspects like your living costs, any future aspirations, and the broader economic trends, how is your willingness to work this month? Furthermore, how would you plan your expenditures on essential goods, keeping in mind good price? Respond with ONLY a single JSON object and NOTHING ELSE (no code fences, no explanations). The JSON must contain two keys: "work" and "consumption", both numbers between 0 and 1, using a step size of 0.02. Example: {"work": 0.84, "consumption": 0.62}

Despite lower earnings, consumption remains high ($13,556.32), supported by the government’s lump-sum redistribution ($6,088.24) and falling prices of essentials (down to $132.72).
